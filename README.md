I'm Fern, a student in Computer Science at Wright State University.  
I'm currently using Github for class work.

### Future Projects
  Over the next year, time permitting, I hope to become more experienced using the Monogame framework to develop 2D and 3D games.
  Possible projects include Chess, Four Colors, a Platformer game of my own design or even a low-poly story-focused game using environments
  and characters created in Blender.  
  #### Chess
  Chess seems like the most simple starting point. It would require 2D sprite rendering for the pieces and some text rendering for
  clocks and gameplay alerts. Since the UI could be based entirely on mouse input, the process of GUI building would not be terribly complex.  
  A tempting challenge when creating a Chess program is to create a networked experience where two computers can run the program
  simultaneously and play one synchronized game against each other. I think I will avoid this challenge for now, I would rather
  complete the project with only local gameplay than risk getting stuck at the very end.
  #### Four Colors
  Four Colors is a simple card game. It provides more of an input challenge than Chess because of interactions between players and cards.  
  Four Colors also has the option of being networked. I may actually attempt this for Four Colors.

### Have a Wonderful Day!
